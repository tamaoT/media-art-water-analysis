## 1. Theme Explanation
I am interested in media art and, in the future, would like to organize or assist in organizing such events. Specifically, I am considering works related to the beautiful theme of "water," and more importantly, those that involve an interactive experience for participants. Therefore, in this analysis, I aim to clarify the contexts and intentions in which past "water"-related "experiential" media art works have been held, based on data collected within the MADB. By examining specific examples of past works, I can ensure the novelty and uniqueness of future media art projects.
2. Analysis 1: Media Art Works with Words Related to "Water" in Their Titles or Descriptions
## 2.1 Target of Analysis
Type: Media Art (Media Art Events, Exhibitions, and Performances)

### 2.2 Analysis Method
I will extract media art works from the MADB where the title or description contains words related to "water," such as "水," "water," "ウォーター" (water in Japanese), and "ウオーター" (water in Japanese). The term "water-related media art" refers to works whose labels or descriptions contain the above words. Note that terms like "みず" or "ミズ" are not considered to mean "water" in this context, and are excluded. Additionally, other terms that indirectly express liquid water are not considered and thus excluded.

### 2.3 Data Acquisition and Organization Method
For data collection, I will use SPARQL queries to filter media art events and exhibitions/performances, targeting those that include water-related terms in their labels and genres. Further, I will hypothesize and verify how "water" is used in the context of these works. MeCab will be used to list the frequency and occurrence of the words outlined in 2.8, and from this, I will verify whether the background and intention of how "water" is used align with my hypothesis and examine the trends in the themes.

### 2.4 Results I

### 2.5 Hypothesis Based on Results I
I hypothesize the following words will appear frequently based on the context of "water":

① Environment, nature, pollution, drought, thirst
Environmental issues related to water have become a major concern in recent years, often explored through various media. Particularly, media art tends to satirically address contemporary social problems more than other art forms. Thus, when media art uses the word "water," it is likely to refer to environmental issues.

② Biology, absorption, excretion
Living beings, including humans, cannot survive without water. However, despite its importance, we rarely acknowledge its presence. This may reflect the growing trend of bio-art, where living organisms are used in creative expression. Thus, media art may suggest the relationship between water and life.

③ Physics, liquid, motion, density, dissolution
Water possesses unique properties compared to other substances. For example, it is rare for a solid to have a lower density than its liquid form. Additionally, the latent heat of fusion for ice is approximately 80 times larger than its specific heat. Media art is adept at expressing these physical properties and raising awareness about them.

### 2.6 Verification of Hypothesis Results II
I will refine the results from Results I by further searching for the hypothesized keywords, narrowing down the results. By examining the actual search results, I will assess whether the hypothesis holds, and discuss my findings in 2.7, Consideration I.
① "Environment": 28/207, "Nature": 18/207, "Pollution": 2/207, "Drought": 0/207, "Thirst": 0/207
② "Biology": 9/207, "Absorption": 0/207, "Excretion": 1/207
③ "Physics": 9/207, "Liquid": 2/207, "Motion": 8/207, "Density": 0/207, "Dissolution": 0/207

### 2.7 Consideration I Based on Results I and II
The hypothesis aligns quite well with the results for works that focus on environmental issues. In particular, the use of "environment" within the context of water-related works was mostly related to environmental problems. However, there were few works that directly pointed to specific issues like water pollution or resource depletion. Instead, the relationship between water and the environment was often explored in an abstract manner, prompting viewers to consider it conceptually through art. This suggests that media art is not necessarily a platform for practical, actionable proposals, but rather one that appeals to the senses and conveys abstract messages.

The number of works that include terms related to "biology" and "physics" were fewer than those focused on "environment." Additionally, even fewer works explicitly explained how specific technologies or methods were used to represent biology or physics. This may be due to the fact that media art is not primarily about showcasing scientific or technological principles, but rather about using those elements to communicate the creator's artistic sensibilities and messages.

Furthermore, the number of works related to "biology" or "physics" remained the same whether we searched with just the term "water" (188 results) or with the additional water-related terms (207 results). This suggests that when works deal with "biology" or "physics," the word "water" is often directly used, rather than using terms like "water" or "ウォーター."

### 2.8 Results III
Next, I will examine which other nouns were most frequently used in proximity to the words "water," "ウォーター," or "ウオーター" by analyzing them with MeCab. I will list them in order of frequency of occurrence.

MeCab Results
I will check the nouns that appeared most often alongside "water" and similar terms and list them by frequency.

2.9 Consideration II Based on Results III
The most frequent words tend to refer to operational aspects, such as time and event organization. However, there are also nouns that provide clues about the themes and intentions of the works. In particular, terms like "video" (126), "sound" (102), "music" (64), and "performance" (52) suggest that many works utilized video and sound. In these cases, "water" was not necessarily the central theme, but rather appeared metaphorically in relation to video and sound. An example is: "In the center of the work, the dark water surface is dotted with water drops, and ripples spread out, while delicate sounds envelop the venue in response" (water state 1 / "water state 1" @en, Yamaguchi Center for Arts and Media [YCAM], Media Art Database, 2024.08.09 confirmed).
